I feel that my GitHub account should have some dedication to George Perry Floyd, as he was murdered on the same day that my account was created (2020, Monday, May 25th)

This repository will be a creative repository for stories, murals, and other works dedicated to the memory of George Floyd.

George Perry Floyd Jr. was an African-American man with a family. On 2020, May 25th, he went to Cup Foods to buy something. The clerk of the store reported him to the police, as he felt that he was going to try and use a counterfeit $20 bill. 4 police officers arrived, one of them (Derek Michael Chauvin) had a history of brutality, yet was still somehow a police officer. Derek stood on the neck of George Floyd for [9 minutes and 29 seconds](#9-29) depriving Floyd of Oyxgen, as he continously exclaimed ["I can't breath"](#Last-words) during the final 2 minutes of this murder, George Floyd was motionless and pulseless, while Chauvin continued to keep his knee on his neck. 2 other officers helped Chauvin murder Floyd, while a 4th prevented onlookers from intervening.

During a medical examination, it was found that George Floyd's heart had completely stopped while being strained. The event is widely known as a homicide, and upon the release of information of what happened here, significant anger came out, and it resulted in one of the most powerful and most organized police brutality protests in American history, known as the George Floyd protests.

Even if the money was counterfeit, this is obviously not how it should have gone down. Derek was clearly hateful of black people, and wanted to kill Floyd. It was a murder (first degree homicide) and it was also a hate crime.

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the George Floyd Protests section</b></p></summary>

After the report of what happened became public, the George Floyd protests began. Mass gatherings of people (even with COVID-19 present) all around the country protested, burned down buildings, and tore down Confederate monuments. Some of their goals were:

- An end to police brutality
- More harsh charges for Derek Chauvin and the other 3 officers (who initially only had paid leave)
- Defunding the police

Georges last words "I can't breath" became a rallying cry in the protests for justice.

9 minutes and 29 seconds (569 seconds) that is how long George was suffocated for. That is how long the suffering lasted. That is what Chauvin did to him.

The reason why `#WhiteLivesMatter` is wrong is because white people aren't discriminated against like black people. `#BLM` raises awareness to the cause of the inequality of black life in countries that have a high rate of racism against people of different races/nationalities, similar to how the Pride flag raises awareness for the persecution and discrimination of homosexuals/LGBTQ+ people

`#AllLivesMatter` is also wrong, as it distracts from the issue of `#BlackLivesMatter` and other equality movements. All lives do matter, but in order to achieve this, equality movements such as `#BlackLivesMatter` must succeed first.
